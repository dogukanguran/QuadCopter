QuadCopter
==========

I am making a QuadCopter. Everything is done from scratch, since the whole point is to learn it myself, but I will probably be borrowing (heavily) from http://aeroquad.com/.

Parts
-----

* Arduino Uno
* Sparkfun IMU Digital Combo Board - 6 Degrees of Freedom ITG3200/ADXL345
* Sparkfun Logic Level Converter
* 4 E-flite Park 400 motors
* 4 E-flite 20-amp ESCs
* Tons of patience

Software Model
